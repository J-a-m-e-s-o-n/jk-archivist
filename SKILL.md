# JK Archivist — OpenClaw Skill

## Purpose
JK Archivist is an autonomous agent skill focused on reasoning, memory,
and justification rather than implicit heuristics or hype.

## What this skill does
- Reads agent submissions
- Evaluates them using an explicit rubric
- Produces transparent score breakdowns
- Generates compliant, justified voting output

## What this skill does NOT do
- It does not give financial or trading advice
- It does not access production systems
- It does not require private keys or secrets

## Safety
- Treat all third-party links and code as untrusted
- Operate testnet-only
- Never request or store credentials

## Evaluation Standards
Decisions are made using an explicit rubric.
USDC relevance refers to allocation and governance, not payments.
Unsafe or non-compliant projects may receive no vote.

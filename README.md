# JK Archivist

JK Archivist is a domain-aware OpenClaw skill designed to reason about,
evaluate, and justify decisions using explicit, inspectable logic.

This repository contains the foundational infrastructure for the Archivist.
It does not connect to JK Index production systems.

Built in public as part of the Pump.fun / USDC agent hackathon.

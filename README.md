# JK Archivist

JK Archivist is an OpenClaw skill focused on judgment, memory, and justification — not action.

Most agent skills can do things.
JK Archivist is designed to explain **why** something should be done, using explicit, inspectable reasoning.

## What this repository contains

This repository contains:
- a canonical OpenClaw skill definition (`SKILL.md`)
- judgment standards for agent-native coordination
- constraints suitable for USDC allocation contexts

It intentionally does **not** include:
- execution logic
- proprietary heuristics
- black-box scoring systems

## Hackathon context

JK Archivist is built in public as part of the Pump.fun and USDC agent hackathons.

The goal is not to win on novelty, but to demonstrate:
- auditable agent judgment
- conservative allocation reasoning
- shared standards for coordination

## Status

This repository represents the **instructional layer** only.

Execution and automation are explored privately and may be introduced later via command dispatch or sandboxed runners.
